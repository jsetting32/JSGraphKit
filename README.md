# JSGraphKit
Lightweight Graphing Library using CoreGraphics.

<h2>How it works</h2>
The library currently consists of two views, JSScatterPlot and JSBarPlot, both of which are subclasses of JSPlot. It's up to the developer to set the paddings of the graphs and data. The API makes it simple and there are default themes to use. Also, the graphs adjust according to its bounds, making porting the library to your project easy and simply by just setting the frame and feeding it data.

<h3>Example</h3>
